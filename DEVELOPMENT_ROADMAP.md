## 🛠️ **Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**

### **Step 1: Verify CI/CD Pipeline** ✅
- [x] Test feature branch CI/CD
- [x] Verify multi-branch support
- [x] Check GitHub Actions execution

### **Step 2: Start Core Features Development**
```bash
# Begin with Auth Service enhancements
1. Implement user registration with email verification
2. Add JWT token refresh mechanism
3. Create role-based access control
4. Test authentication flow end-to-end
```

### **Step 3: Set Up Development Environment**
```bash
# Prepare for feature development
1. Create feature branches for each service
2. Set up local testing environment
3. Configure development database
4. Set up API testing tools (Postman/Insomnia)
```
